						This is a sandbox application where you can play with a
						basic, manually-tuned
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">Rotational PID Controller</a>.
						<br />
						<br />
						The goal of this controller is to match the angle of the ball to the target angle of the system

						<br />
						<br />
						The target angle is defined	 by the mouses angle relative to the center of the larger circle.

						It uses a <b>nested pid</b> to control the angular acceleration and angular velocity of the red circle.
						<br />
						<br />
